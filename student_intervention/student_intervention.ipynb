    "###Decision Trees : \n",
    "- **Complexity:** I'm not sure how to compute the complexities for a generic decision tree.  However, if you assume that the data can be split perfectly at each level of the tree then you can calculate the following.  Training time is $O(n_f n_s^2 \\log(n_s))$ in time.  Query time is $O(\\log(n_f))$.  The storage cost of the tree is $O( n_f^2 )$.\n",
    "- **Applications:** Decision trees are useful when individual features can efficiently split the data.  For example, in the case of determining if it will rain, knowing weather or not there are clouds in the sky is a feature worth splitting your algorithm on.  Moreover, Decision trees are flexible with regards to the feature space.  The feature space can be numerical or categorical or a product of both.\n",
    "- **Strengths:**  Decisision trees are human interpretable (assuming the features are), and they are space efficient.  Morevoer, they have very low bias.  In the language of function spaces, the decision trees are generated by rectangular indicator functions on the feature space.  The function space generated by these box-functions is just the space of measurable function on the feature space (with range in the target set).  In otherwords, Decision trees have lots of expressive power.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:**  The training algorithms are always suboptimal because the building of an optimal decision tree is an non-polynomial time problem (as far as we know).  One side-effect of this sub-optimality is that the classifier is unstable with respect to perturbations in the data.  Morevoer, Decision trees are subject to overfitting.  This is especially the case when the leaves contain only one member of the training set, which is the natural place where training ends unless you actively prevent this outcome through pruning or other variance reduction measures.\n",
    "- **Why should we condiser it?:**  We should consider decision trees because our data is a mixture of numerical and categorical.  Moreover, much of our data is binary, and thus well suited to the decision tree paradigm (if in fact a good decision tree can be found).\n",

    "- **Complexity:** Training time is $O(1)$ in time and $O(n)$ in space.  Querying is (worst case scenario) $O(n)$ in time, and $O(1)$ in additional space.\n",
    "- **Applications:** Naive Bayes assumes that each piece of data is obtained independently of the others (in the sense of probability theory).  If this is in fact the case, then this algorithm might even be optimal if one can choose the correct model for $P(y \\mid x)$.  Verifying independence is typically not possible, but you can certainly accumulate evidence for this assumption.\n",
    "- **Strengths:**  Fast training time.  If you are only going to make a single query this might be a very efficient algorithm.  Additionally, if the independence assumption is true, Naive Bayes can have very low bias.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:**  If your features are not independent, than this algorithm will not be good at determining the underlying (and possibly lower dimensional) structure of the data.  In otherwords, when the independence assumption is false, Naive Bayes will yield a predictor with high bias.  For example, if there are only two feature $(x_1,x_2)$ and if $x_1 = x_2$ (so independence is violated), an algorithm like a decision tree might be better because it will only use one of these features.  However, Naive Bayes will merely place a Guassian blob (or some sort of distribution) around each point in the training set when the symmetry of the data set should really allow for a \"line\\'s worth\" of blobs. Lastly, there is potential for overfitting, as Naive Bayes is a lazy learner and thus prone to simply memorizing the training set rather then generalizing it.\n",
    "This overfitting can be especially pronounced when the prediction algorithm encounters an input which is far away from its training data.  In this case $P(y \\mid x) \\propto P(y) \\prod P(x_i \\mid y)$.  If the label $y$ is absent then $P(y)$ is estimated to be $0$, which contradicts the fact that you just encountered it.  If $y$ has been encountered, but the feature vector $x$ is far from the training set then $P(x \\mid y)$ will be nearly $0$, and we get a bad estimator again.  I'm not sure if this is a serious disadvantage worth mentioning since any supervised algorithm should perform poorly on novel data that was not represented well in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why did you choose this?**  I have not tested for independence, however if the samples are independent, than this algorithm might beat the other algorithms I've chosen to test.  Many educators implicitly hold this indpendence assumption (at least in some high level sense) when they speak of each student being judged independently, so perhaps there is some merit to it.\n",

Moreover, the metric can be chosen to specialize the algorithm to data sets with Boolean features and numerical features, such as what we have here.

    "**Choice of model:** I've come to the conclusion that the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is best suited to the data.\n",
    "The $F_1$-scores for Naive Bayes and Decision trees seem to indicate both algorithms are suffering over-fit when we use the out-of-the-box implementations.  This is because the $F_1$-scores seem to vary by more than 0.15 when comparing the score of the test set vs the training set.  However, in the case of a training set of size 100, the $F_1$-score of k-nearest neighbors only varies by .036, which suggests that we are not suffering from over-fit.\n",
    "Moreover, the $F_1$ score on the test set is as high for k-nearest neighbors as it is for the other algorithms tested.\n",
    "A high $F_1$-score indicates:\n",
    "   1. When a student is likely to fail, our algorithm will suggest intervention (i.e. high recall)\n",
    "   2. When the algorithm suggests intervention, it is usually the case that he or she is in danger of failing (i.e. high precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are both things which we'd like to maximize in our intervention algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A potential draw-back of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is that when there are many many records (e.g. 10,000) then the time it takes for the computer to determine intervention might get large (i.e. prediction for k-nearest neighbors does not scale well with data size).  This is not the case with support vector machines, which were the alternative algorithms which I tested.  However, the current data set consists of 395 students, a relatively small number.  Given 400 students every year, this will become a problem in about 25 years.  Actually, this is a decent example of an embarassingly parallelizable algorithm.  So this concern is really mute if one is willing to take advantage of parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the model works:** The k-nearest neighbors algorithm works as follows.  Given a student, whom we'd like to determine weather or not to intervene, the algorithm will find k students in our data who are most similar (where similar is defined by a customizable distance function).  The algorithm will use the outcomes of these nearby students to compute a probability of intervention for the student in question, perhaps by a simple vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Fine tuning:**  One of the free parameters is what we use to measure the similarity between students.  This is given by a distance function. We can also vary k, the number of neighbors.  Below we consider 6 possible metrics, and k = 1,2,4,8,16,32,64. It appears the optimal metric (in terms of $F_1$-scores) is the Kulinski distance with and optimal k of 32.  The F<sub>1</sub> score of the optimal classifier is 0.774."
